In this project I investigate the pricing of American options, which can be exercised at any time before maturity. 

In AmericanOptions.ipynb I discuss the implementaion of The Longstaff-Schwartz algorithm to price American call and put options.

In HestonSurface.ipynb I calibrate a Heston process to the market call options data for AMZN, and then compare the American put prices predicted by the LSM algorithm to the observed market put data.
